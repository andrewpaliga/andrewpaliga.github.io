      <p class="lead">Reduce atmospheric carbon by sequestering wood.</p>
      <h3>About us</h3>

      <p>We are an early stage startup with a mission to reduce atmospheric carbon levels by sequestering waste wood. </p>
      <p>Today in North American over 200 million tons of waste wood from lumber is generated annually. The majority of this waste wood is burnt for energy or is disposed in landfills. These processes result in 150 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, the equivalent of 33 million vehicles.</p>

      <p>Our vision is that instead of burning or disposting of waste wood, we keep its carbon locked within its organic matter by burying in such a way to prevent decomposition. This would result in massive emissions reductions and could eventualy convert the lumber industry into a carbon sink. </p>

      <h3>Our challenge</h3>
      <p> How do you bury hundreds of millions tons of waste wood economically, securely, and at scale without letting it decompose?</p>
      <p>
        You look to an industry that has been doing something similar for centuries: waste management. In fact, todays landfills already work as a significant carbon storage mechanism for waste wood, as their environements natually slow down decay.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are working with industry experts to find a process that meets the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Organic material only burial site</li>
        <li>Wood processed and stored in such a way to prevenet decomposition indefinitely</li>
        <li>Verifiable carbon offsets from waste wood processed</li>
        </ul>

      <p>
        There is much evidence that wood can be preserve for extrmely long lengths of time under the right conditions:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.china.org.cn/english/MATERIAL/192520.htm">2500 year old wooden coffin burried 1.5m almost fully intact</a></li>

          <li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956053X07004047">A study of Australian landfill waste found that the carbon in wood was still 90% intact after 46 years.</a></li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Alpha Project</h3> 
      <p>
        Once more research is completed, and the right team is assmembled, we plan to run a proof-of-concept project near Ottawa, Ontario. Our target is to sequester 10,000 tons of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions at around $100 per ton. A small investment round will be completed at this time.
      </p>
      <h3>Q&A</h3> 

      <p>
        <b>How much carbon dioxide is released from 1 kg of wood?</b><br>
         The chemical composition of wood varies from species to species, but is approximately 50% carbon, 42% oxygen, 6% hydrogen, 1% nitrogen, and 1% other elements by weight for dry wood. 
     </p>
     <p> Once the carbon is released into the atmosphere through combustion or decomposition, the carbon atom will bond with oxygen to form C02 at a weight ratio of 1 to 3.67. So the complete combustion of 1 kg of dry wood will result in approx 1.8 kg of CO2.
     </p>
     <p>
         For our estimates, we are conservatively assuming 50% absolute moisture rate. So 1 kg of waste wood converts to appoximately 0.9 kg of carbon dioxide emissions
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why is sequestering wood a preferred solution to burning it for energy?</b><br>
        Today, bioenergy from wood is considered carbon neutral because the harvest trees will theoretically be replaced by new trees, displacing the CO2 emissions combusion. In comparison to this, wood sequestration is carbon negative because while the replacement trees still soak up displaced CO2, the original CO2 is never released back into the atmosphere. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As global prices on carbon capture rise with the urgency to stave off runaway climate change, it's an innevibility that sequestering — instead of burning it for energy — will be the economic winner. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Could this technology be expanded to other wood sources such a diseased, damaged or dead trees?</b><br>
        Yes, it's just a question of costs and logistics. Decaying forest are responsibile for 220 Gt (700% of 2019 human C02 emissions) of CO2 emissioms globally and there is certainly an opportunity to put a dent in this by selective sequestration. (Ex. Dead forests from teh bore ash beatle in canada emitted 240 Megatons of carbon dioxide from decay and burtning)
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Won't storing wood for the purpose of carbon capture take up too much space?</b><br>
        A 100m3 cube of compressed would can store more than a million tons of CO2. 1km3 cube store a gigaton (about 15% of 2019 human emissions)
      </p>
       <p> It's important to note that regardless of how you remove CO2 from the atmosphere, you will need to store the carbon somewhere. You can't store pure carbon (it's inert) so the upper limit of density is probably something like 85% (that of crude oil). Considering wood can reach 50% density, and it's one of the most pletiful, and replenishible resources on the planet leveraging it for carbon sequestration seems like a good idea.
