 	Reduce atmospheric carbon by sequestering wood.
</p>


### About us

We are an early stage startup with a mission to reduce atmospheric carbon levels by sequestering waste wood.

Today in North American over 200 million tons of waste wood from lumber is generated annually. The majority of this waste wood is burnt for energy or is disposed in landfills. These processes result in 150 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, the equivalent of 33 million vehicles.

Our vision is that instead of burning or disposting of waste wood, we keep its carbon locked within its organic matter by processing and burying it to prevent decomposition. This would result in massive emissions reductions and could eventualy convert the lumber industry into a carbon sink.

### Our challenge

To be successful we will need to bury hundreds of millions tons of waste wood economically, securely, and at scale without letting it decompose.

To do this we are going to work with industry that has been doing something similar for centuries: waste management. In fact, todays landfills already work as a significant carbon storage mechanism for waste wood, as their environements inadvertently [slow decay](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956053X07004047).

We are working with industry experts to optimize the process so that it meets the following criteria:
  - Organic material only burial site
  - Wood processed and stored in such a way to prevenet decomposition indefinitely
  - Verifiable carbon offsets from waste wood stored

We are encouraged by the ample evidence that wood can be preserve for extremely long lengths of time under the right conditions:
  - [2500 year old wooden coffin burried 1.5m almost fully intact](http://www.china.org.cn/english/MATERIAL/192520.htm)
  - [Ancient tress preserved for 50,000+ years in peat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp_kauri) (Swamp kauri)
  - [A study of Australian landfill waste found that the carbon in wood was still 90% intact after 46 years.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956053X07004047)

### Alpha Project

Once more research is completed, and the right team is assmembled, we plan to run a proof-of-concept project near Ottawa, Ontario. Our target is to sequester 10,000 tons of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions at around $100 per ton. A small investment round will be completed at this time.

### Q&A

**How much carbon dioxide is released from 1 kg of wood?**  
The chemical composition of wood varies from species to species, but is approximately 50% carbon, 42% oxygen, 6% hydrogen, 1% nitrogen, and 1% other elements by weight for dry wood. 

Once the carbon is released into the atmosphere through burning or decomposition, the carbon atom will bond with oxygen to form CO<sub>2</sub> at a weight ratio of 1 to 3.67. So the complete combustion of 1 kg of dry wood will result in approx 1.8 kg of CO<sub>2</sub>.

For our estimates, we are conservatively assuming 50% absolute moisture rate. So 1 kg of waste wood converts to appoximately 0.9 kg of carbon dioxide emissions

**Why sequester wood instead of using is for bioenergy?**  
Today, [bioenergy from wood](https://www.pbl.nl/en/publications/climate-effects-of-wood-used-for-bioenergy) is considered carbon neutral because the harvest trees will eventually be replaced by new trees, displacing the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from burning. 

Wood sequestration, in comparison to this, is carbon negative because while the replacement trees still soak up displaced CO<sub>2</sub>, the original CO<sub>2</sub> is never released back into the atmosphere. 

As global prices on carbon capture rise with the urgency to stave off runaway climate change, it's an innevibility that sequestering — instead of burning for energy — will become the most economically beneficial use of waste wood.

**How much space will be required to store wood for the purpose of carbon capture?**  
A 100 m<sup>3</sup> cube of compressed would can store more than a million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>. 1 km<sup>3</sup> cube could store a gigaton of CO<sub>2</sub> (about 15% of 2019 human emissions)

It's important to note that regardless of how you remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, it will likely need to be stored somewhere. Pure carbon cannot be stored (it's inert) so the upper limit of density is probably something like 85% (that of crude oil). Considering wood can reach 50% density, and it's one of the most pletiful, and replenishible resources on the planet, we are optimistic about its use for carbon sequestration.

**Could this technology be expanded to other wood sources such a diseased, damaged or dead trees?**  
Yes, it's just a question of costs and logistics. The decay and burning of wood biomass is responsibile for 220 Gt (700% of 2019 human CO<sub>2</sub> emissions) of CO<sub>2</sub> emissioms globally and there is certainly an opportunity to put a dent in this by selective sequestration.

About 20% of Canada's total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the year." text="Trees killed by the mountain pine beatle are estimated to have emitted 150 Mg of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2018.

Although we are motivated by future application of wood sequestration, our focus in the near term is waste wood as there already centrally located processing sites that will simplify logistics and minimize costs.
